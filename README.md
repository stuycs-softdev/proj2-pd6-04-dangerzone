Project: BUILD WEBSITE COMBINING IDEAS ON TOPIC SELECTED.

OmniThinker: 
Our project features an interactive writing tool that allows users to insert a genre and then
start typing. As the user starts typing, suggestions pop up on a right hand toolbar of the window.
The genre chosen will have various points relating to it pop up on the toolbar, which the user can
click on to expand or contract (+ and -).

On expanding, the user decides whether the information is relevant or irrelevant to the topic at hand.
As the user writes and uses the suggestions from the toolbar, more options pop up on the toolbar, offering 
more advice and possible points to hit on in the course of writing. 

Once the user has finished writing, he can then export what he has written into an external PDF or text file.

For instance: User selects the topic of stem cells for a science paper. Possible topics that pop up on the sidebar
are: Synthesis, Methodology, Research Patents, Properties, Identification, Embryonic, Fetal and Adult stem cells.
As the user selects and uses the information in a topic, other ideas pop onto the toolbar for the user's perusal. 

Cool Feature: If time permits, we are thinking of connecting keystrokes to musical notes, such that one can use 
OmniThinker with Jazzical, Piano, or other instrumental notes accompanying the creative thinking.
